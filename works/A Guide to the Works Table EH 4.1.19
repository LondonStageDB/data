A Guide to the “Works Table”

1660-1670
For this decade, I went through The London Stage and recorded all the titles. I also conducted some research into the author attribution and publication date of the works using the articles “Attribution Problems in English Drama, 1660-1700” and “Lost English Plays, 1660-1700” by Robert Hume and Judith Milhous, EBBO, and the ESTC. For a detailed record of the decisions I made, see the document “Authors Researched Log.” 

1670-1700
For these decades, I went through The London Stage and recorded all the titles. I did not do any research into the author attribution or publication date. For a record of my notes, see the document “Notes for 1670-1700.”

1700-1720
For these decades, I used William J. Burling’s published A Checklist of New Plays and Entertainments on the London Stage as a starting point for entering information, but then I went through each page of The London Stage and recorded the differences. For a record of my notes, see the document “Notes for 1700-1720.”

1720-1737
For these decades, I used William J. Burling’s published A Checklist of New Plays and Entertainments on the London Stage. However, I did not go through each page of The London Stage. I only used The London Stage to check what Burling wrote and to quickly look for alternate spellings of the titles. For a record of my notes, see the document “Notes for 1720-1800.”

1737-1800
For these decades, I used William J. Burling’s unpublished document, “Burling New Plays through 1810.” Like with 1720-1737, I did not go through each page of The London Stage. I only used The London Stage to check what Burling wrote and to quickly look for alternate spellings of the titles. For a record of my notes, see the document “Notes for 1720-1800.”

Other Important Notes 
-	There are a few cases where works had multiple sources. In these cases, SourceAuthor1 matches with Source1 and SourceAuthor2 matches with Source2. 
-	When information was found only in Burling’s book/document, I listed the information in one of the “researched” columns. 
-	In Burling’s book/document there was a lot of information about sources for plays. I only recorded this information if it stated that the work was an adaptation, a translation, or if the adaptation/translation was referenced in The London Stage. 
-	Composers are listed as authors of a work, but they always follow librettist/writer. 
-	The information in the author sheet all comes from the Dictionary of National Biography.
-	Due to some searching bugs in the DNB, I think it is likely that the author information is incomplete. You might be able to find information for some of the authors with more through research.  
-	The alternate names for the authors come from The London Stage, Burling, and the DNB.
