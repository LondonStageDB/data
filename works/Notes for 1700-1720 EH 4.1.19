Misc. Problems  
The page numbers refer to the London Stage vol II.i
-	The School-Boy; or, The Comical Rivals (pg. 27, 40) – Burling lists the author Cibber, but I can’t find anywhere in the London Stage that confirms this. Burling refers only to page 27 of the London Stage. But, on page 40, there is another reference to what is, I think, the same play, but I am not 100% sure. 
-	 The Force of Friendship (pg. 219, 221) – This play is listed twice in Burling’s book. But, as far as I can tell, it is the same play, one was just published with a different afterpiece. So, I have only listed it once in the works table. 
-	The Mad Lover (pg. 12, 35) – In Burling’s book, he refers to page 35 of the London Stage. On page 35 there is a reference to music from The Mad Lover. I see this earlier on page 12 as well. I am not sure how I should list this work, so, I am leaving it as it appears in Burling. 
-	The Jew of Venice ¬– In Burling’s book (pg. 25), there is a reference to a masque that is currently not listed anywhere in the works table. Should I list this? 
-	The Double Gallant; or, The Sick Lady’s Cure – In Burling’s book (pg. 45), there are several plays that Burling says this was adapted from. I’m not sure if this is really what we are trying to capture in the “source” fields in the works table, so I did not include this title. 
-	Marriage a la Mode (pg. 31) – There are two plays called Marriage a la Mode in the Works Table. I am not sure which on this afterpiece refers to.  
-	Thysis (pg. 246) – This title was not listed in Burling’s book, so to be consistent, I did not include it in the Works Table.
-	The Villain (pg. 236) – I was not sure if this play is the same as The Villain by Thomas Porter, which is already listed in the works table. 
-	The Governor of Barcelona; or, The Spanish Wives (pg. 252) – This title was not listed in Burling’s book, so to be consistent, I did not include it in the Works Table.
-	The Loves of Baldo and Media (pg. 280) – This title was not listed in Burling’s book, so to be consistent, I did not include it in the Works Table.
-	Albian Queens (pg. 332) – I wasn’t sure if all of these are the Haines adaptation or if some of them are alternate titles for Banks’ play.
-	Bonduca (pg. 364) – The London Stage says that this play by Beaumont and Fletcher is revised – I am assuming it is the revision that I already have
-	The Anatomish (pg. 386) – I think this is a typo in TLS, so I did not list it in the Works Table 
-	A Sea Voyage (pg. 394) – I don’t know which Sea Voyage this is, so I did not list it
-	The Country Wife (pg. 414) – This was listed as “revised.” I did not list it again 
-	The Feigned Courtizans; or, The Nest of Fools (pg. 419) – I think this is a typo in TLS, so I did not list it in the Works Table
-	Woman,s a Riddle (pg. 427) – I think this is a typo in TLS, so I did not list it in the Works Table

The following page numbers refer to The London Stage vol II.ii
-	King Henry (pg. 495) – I don’t know if this should be listed with 1 Henry IV or as a separate play. I did not list it.
-	Les Filles Errantes (pg. 523) – Burling lists this as a mainpiece, but I only found it as an afterpiece in TLS, so that is what I listed. 
-	Le Baron de la Crasse (pg. 525) – TLS lists the author as Doisson and Burling lists Poisson. I followed TLS and listed Doisson. 
-	Alrequin Valourd; or, Harlequin a Blunderer (pg. 528) – I wasn’t sure how to list the author here. I listed D.M.P., but it looks like from Burling (75)Michael Coltelli and Procope-Couteaux are other names. 
-	Harlequin Hydaspes (pg. 541) – TLS lists the author as Mrs. Aubert and Burlings lists Mr. Aubert. I followed TLS and listed Mrs. Aubert. 
-	Numitor (pg. 575) – I was not sure if I needed to list the engineer / set designer who is referenced here. 
-	The False Friend (pg. 586) – I did not know which version The False Friend this should be listed with, so right now, I have left it off the works table.
